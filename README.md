In this project we propose a Face Mask Detection project that consists of 2 phases,
namely training and testing. We will build a CNN model to detect whether or not
someone is wearing a face mask in this project. As a result, the face mask detection
system constructed using openCV and Tensorflow and based on deep learning and
computer vision concepts is very useful for detecting face mask in both static and
video pictures. For Covid-19, there is currently no effective face mask detection
application, which is in high demand for transportation means, residential areas, and
other enterprises to assure safety. So, if this project goes well, the covid 19 face mask
detector we're working on today could be utilised to help protect you and others.

As a result, the model we will create for this project can be employed in crowded
areas such as malls, bus stops, and other public places.
